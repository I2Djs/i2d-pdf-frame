```html
<pdfFrame type="pdf" width="595" height="841">
    <i-page>
    </i-page>
</pdfFrame>
```
The `<pdfFrame>` tag is used to create a client instance for rendering graphical content in the specified format.
  
  * type="pdf": The type attribute specifies the output format for rendering the graphical content. In this case, it is set to "pdf", indicating that the content will be rendered as a PDF document. Possible values are `pdf/canvas/svg/webgl`

  * width="595": The width attribute sets the width of the client area for rendering the graphical content. Here, it is set to "595", indicating a width of 595 units.

  * height="841": The height attribute sets the height of the client area. It is set to "841", indicating a height of 841 units.
  
  Inside the <pdfFrame> tag, you can add one or more <i-page> elements to represent different pages within the PDF document and define the content to be rendered on each page.
